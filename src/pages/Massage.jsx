          My journey as a massage therapist began in 2005 in India, where I
          lived in an Ashram, practiced meditation, and discovered the
          transformative Ayurvedic Yoga massage from Master Kusum Modak. This
          life-changing experience ignited my passion for studying and mastering
          this healing art. Since then, Iâ€™ve dedicated myself to continuous
          learning, refining my techniques to provide the most effective and
          rejuvenating experiences. Sharing this ancient wisdom and therapeutic
          touch is my purpose, helping others find relaxation, healing, and
          harmony.
